April 13th, 2012 ---> Added special functions SObtainP and SObtainSpectrum. These functions take as a 
                      second input (after the flux image input) an image of variances. If you don't 
                      have an image of variances available, just use the functions ObtainP and ObtainSpectrum.

                               ~ HOW TO INSTALL THE MODULE ~
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.- On console, do "python setup.py install" for a system install.  Append "--user" for local install.

 2.- That's it! Information on how to use it is given on the Test.py file attached to the package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1.- What is the "Length" argument that I have to input to obtain the light fraction coefficients
       and the spectrum?

    A: Length is the number of pixels counted from the center (i.e. counting the center pixel as 0),
       below and above of this pixel, that contains the spectrum. The number of pixels actually
       taken to model the light fractions depend on the spacing between polynomials. If, for example,
       a length of 4 pixels and a spacing of S=0.6 pixels is requested, the number of polynomials
       that we can make from the center is:

                                              Length/S= 6.66 ~ 7

       Then we have a total of 7*2+1=15 polynomials to fit. According to this, we must take 7*S+S
       pixels above and 7*S+S pixels below the center in order to have our 15 polynomials equally 
       spaced and with enough pixels to model them. In this case, we must take 7*S+S=4.2+0.6=4.8
       pixels above and below the center to form the total number of polynomials (i.e. we now take
       information of 5 pixels, not 4). This increase of aperture in 2 pixels doesn't affect the 
       final result because the pixels far from the center get less weight anyways.

   2.- Why do I have to give the used spacing S between polynomials used in the ObtainP function
       to the ObtainSpectrum function?

    A: The reason lies behind Pixel Resampling (H. Hensberge & W. Vershueren,1990). When we resample
       the pixels that cover our spectrum we use the spacing to find the fraction of pixel we are
       going to use on our measurements for the light fractions in the ObtainP function. Then, when 
       we obtain our spectrum, we have to obtain that same fraction of flux from the same pixel in 
       order to consider only that part of the flux on our weighted sum.
