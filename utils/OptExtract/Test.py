----------------------------------------------------------------
The P Function.

Returns an array with the P[i][j] coefficients, the modeled
light fractions.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here we pass the matrix, coefficients and lengths to the C programmed module. To call this
function of the module we have to do:

  Marsh.ObtainP(M,T,MRows,MCols,TLength,Aperture,RON,GAIN,NSigma,S,N,MODE)

Where the inputs are:

  M:       Matrix of the image containing the pixel values with the spectrum's wavelength direction on the column direction.
           It is assumed that the image passed is sky-substracted.

  T:       Trace vector's coefficients (D_N,D_(N-1),D_(N-2)...,D_0) where the trace vector is in the form sum(D_n*x^n), n=0...N.
           The trace vector is assumed to be on matrix coordinates, with the horizontal 0 (i.e. x/column 0) on the first horizontal
           pixel (from left to right) to have spectrum data.

  MRows:   Number of rows of the M matrix.

  MCols:   Number of columns of the M matrix.

  TLength: Number of elements (length) of the trace vector that contains the coefficients.

  Aperture:Number of pixels, from the center pixel, of the aperture radius.

  RON:     Read Out Noise of the measurements (in electrons).

  GAIN:    Gain of the CCD in electrons/ADU

  NSigma:  Number of times we multiply sigma to get a confidence interval.

  S:       The spacing between the polynomials to be fitted (see Marsh, 1989). Set this to one
           if Horne's algorithm is going to be applied.

  N:       The number of coefficients of the polynomials to be fitted (see Marsh, 1989, Horne,
           1986).

  MODE:    Set this to 0 if Marsh's algorithm is desired (curved trace). Any other number will
           produce Horne's algorithm to be applied to the data.

  min_col: Pixel coordinates of the input data to start operating from. If zero, the MRows input is used instead.

  max_col: Pixel coordinates of the input data to end operating from.  If zero, the MCols input is used instead.

The output is a flattened python list that we convert to a Numpy Array (with the asarray() function) and then
convert in matrix form doing a resize.

    data=hdulist[0].data                             # ... and we obtain the image matrix.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The getSpectrum function.

Returns a matrix with three rows:

        First row:        Pixel coordinates (taken from the first horizontal/column/x point with data) of the fluxes and variances.
        Second row:       Flux values for the coordinates on the first row, same column.
        Third row:        Variances of the respective flux values.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Here we pass the image matrix, the P Coefficients, coefficients of trace vector and lengths to C. To call this
function we do:

  Marsh.ObtainSpectrum(M,T,P,MRows,MCols,TLength,Length,RON,GAIN,S,CSigma)

Where the inputs of the ObtainSpectrum function are:

  M:       Matrix of the image containing the pixel values with the spectrum's wavelength direction on the column direction.

  T:       Trace vector's coefficients (D_N,D_(N-1),D_(N-2)...,D_0) where the trace vector is in the form sum(D_n*x^n), n=0...N.
           The trace vector is assumed to be on matrix coordinates, with the horizontal 0 (i.e. x/column 0) on the first horizontal
           pixel (from left to right) to have spectrum data.

  P:       Coefficients of each image value obtained on the ObtainP function.

  MRows:   Number of rows of the M/P matrix.

  MCols:   Number of columns of the M/P matrix.

  TLength: Number of elements (length) of the trace vector that contains the coefficients.

  Length:  Number of pixels, from the center pixel, of the aperture radius.

  RON:     Read Out Noise of the measurements (in electrons).

  GAIN:    Gain of the CCD in electrons/ADU

  S:       The spacing between the fitted polynomials. Set this to one
           if Horne's algorithm was applied.

  CSIgma:  Number, in sigmas, for the cosmic ray rejection.

  min_col: Pixel coordinates of the input data to start operating from. If zero, the MRows input is used instead.

  max_col: Pixel coordinates of the input data to end operating from.  If zero, the MCols input is used instead.
